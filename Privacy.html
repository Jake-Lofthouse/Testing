        <h1>Privacy Policy for parkrunner tourist App</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 04, 2025 <!-- Updated date --></p>

        <p>Welcome to the parkrunner tourist app. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data, including location information, and outlines our commitment to protecting your privacy. We comply with GDPR, UK Data Protection Act 2018 and other applicable laws. <!-- Added compliance --></p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The parkrunner tourist app uses location services to enhance your experience by providing relevant information about nearby parkrun events and points of interest (e.g., hotels, cafés, camping). Here’s what you need to know about the information we collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We request approximate device location (via browser Geolocation API) only with your explicit consent, to fetch nearby features. This is used solely for real-time functionalities and is not stored persistently. No names, emails, IP addresses, cookies, or usage analytics are collected. <!-- Expanded: Added consent, no cookies --></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The location information is used exclusively within the App to deliver the following functionalities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Event Discovery:</strong> Helping you find parkrun events near your current location.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. Location data (e.g., lat/lon coordinates) is processed ephemerally: briefly sent to our secure server-side proxy for API queries, then discarded immediately (no logging or retention). Your data remains on your device where possible and is not accessible to us or any third parties. All transmissions use HTTPS, with input validation and domain restrictions. <!-- Updated: Mention proxy transmission/security --></p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The parkrunner tourist app does not share or sell your data to third parties. We use secure proxies for limited third-party APIs (e.g., TomTom for mapping/POIs, OpenWeatherMap for forecasts) that process anonymised queries (no personal data sent) ephemerally, without retaining or sharing your information. <!-- Updated: Added specific services, clarified no sharing --></p>

        <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
        <p><!-- New section: GDPR rights -->
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent & Withdrawal:</strong> Grant/deny location access anytime via browser settings. Deny = fallback to default coordinates (e.g., The world).</li>
            <li><strong>Access/Delete:</strong> No stored data, so no requests needed. Feel free contact us for confirmation.</li>
            <li><strong>Complaints:</strong> Reach out at parkrunnertouristapp@gmail.com</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this section with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information. We review this policy annually. <!-- Added annual review --></p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:parkrunnertouristapp@gmail.com">parkrunnertouristapp@gmail.com</a>.</p>
